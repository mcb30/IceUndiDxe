 *\section secA  Operating System Interface
 * The Shared Code is common code designed to coordinate, and
 * make common, the initialization and other hardware tasks.
 *
 * \section sec2 Operating System Dependent Files
 * Each driver is required to implement one or two files, ice_osdep.c and
 * ice_osdep.h for the operating system dependent portions of the shared code.
 * The following are required in the osdep file(s) (in header file if
 * implemented as a macro/inline-function or in the C file if implemented as a
 * function with a prototype in the header file).

 * \section sec5 List implementation details
 * The LIST macros are defined to implement a doubly-linked list which embeds
 * the LIST_ENTRY structures as elements of the items linked to the list. The
 * macros assume that pointer arithmetic can be used to extract the container
 * structure from the LIST_ENTRY element and the structure type.
 * <br>
 * INIT_LIST_HEAD is expected to be able to initialize a pointer to a new
 * list.
 * <br>
 * LIST_EMPTY is called to determine if a list pointed to by a given list head
 * contains any elements. Calling LIST_EMPTY on an uninitialized list head
 * results in undefined implementation specific behavior.
 * <br>
 * LIST_ADD is called to add an element to the front of a list pointed to by
 * a given list head. It is assumed that LIST_ADD will perform any required
 * initialization for the LIST_ENTRY_TYPE structure.
 * <br>
 * LIST_ADD_AFTER is called to insert a new element into the list after the
 * given element. It is assumed that LIST_ADD_AFTER will perform any required
 * initialization for the LIST_ENTRY_TYPE structure.
 * <br>
 * LIST_FIRST_ENTRY is called to obtain a pointer to the structure containing
 * the first LIST_ENTRY_TYPE element of a list pointed to by the given list
 * head. Calling LIST_FIRST_ENTRY with an empty or uninitialized list results
 * in undefined implementation specific behavior.
 * <br>
 * LIST_LAST_ENTRY is called to obtain a pointer to the structure containing
 * the last LIST_ENTRY_TYPE element of a list pointed to by the given list
 * head. Calling LIST_LAST_ENTRY with an empty or uninitialized list results
 * in undefined implementation specific behavior.
 * <br>
 * LIST_ADD_TAIL is called to insert a new element to the end of list pointed
 * by the given head. It is assumed that LIST_ADD_TAIL will perform any
 * required initialization for the LIST_ENTRY_TYPE structure.
 * <br>
 * LIST_NEXT_ENTRY is called to obtain a pointer to the structure containing
 * the next LIST_ENTRY_TYPE element in the list, given a pointer to the current
 * structure.
 * <br>
 * LIST_DEL is called to remove an element from its associated list.
 * <br>
 * LIST_FOR_EACH_ENTRY is used to loop through every element of a list, using
 * a pointer of the containing type as an iterator. It is expected to have
 * semantics similar to for loops, and can take either a single or block
 * statement following it. Calling LIST_DEL on the iterator is not safe and
 * results in undefined implementation specific behavior. If deleting elements
 * from the list while iterating is required, use LIST_FOR_EACH_ENTRY_SAFE
 * instead.
 * <br>
 * LIST_FOR_EACH_ENTRY_SAFE is used to loop through every element of a list
 * guaranteeing safety to delete the iterator element even during the
 * iteration. It requires two temporary pointers both of the struct type used
 * as the iterator. If the ability to remove the iterated element from the
 * list is required, then LIST_FOR_EACH_ENTRY_SAFE must be used instead of
 * LIST_FOR_EACH_ENTRY.
 * <br>
 * LIST_REPLACE_INIT is used to replace old head by a new head. This will also
 * reinitialize the old head to make it a empty list head. The new list does
 * not have to be initialized for this function.
